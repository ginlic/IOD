    "The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) spearheads the conduct of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) nationwide. The survey, which is undertaken every three (3) years, is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure, including, among others, levels of consumption by item of expenditure, sources of income in cash, and related information affecting income and expenditure levels and patterns in the Philippines.\n",

    "The purpose of today's lab is to use simulation to visualize the sampling distribution for the sample mean. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that as our sample size gets larger, the sampling distribution of the sample mean converges to a normal distribution. Therefore, when we have a large sample size, we can say that the sampling distribution for the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the distribution from which we are sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by taking a look at the data, **`Total Household Income`** will serve as a \"population\" for the purposes of this lab."
